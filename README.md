# SNNL
SNNL - Simple Neural Network Library for C++

The framework was invented to build an OOP-oriented neural network structure.

The library structure is divided into three main parts:

1) SNNL MathCore is the part responsible for the mathematical backend of neural network training
2) SNNL Neural Network Constructor is the part responsible for describing a neural network in a class-oriented OOP structure.
3) SNNL Network Translator is the part responsible for broadcasting from classes to the library's mathematical backend system.

Provisions:

1) The structure of a neural network should be described by classes and their totality.

2) A PC with sufficient power may be required to train a neural network.

3) For the operation of the created neural networks, it should be sufficient to use the ecosystem of microcontrollers or their composition.
